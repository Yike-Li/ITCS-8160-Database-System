## Setup and Run

* Node.js enviroment setup
  
  Follow the link https://nodejs.org/en/ for the installation.
  
* MySQL database setup and run

  Using the Dump-CampusRide.sql file to import database in your MySQL server. 
  For the bussiness rule concern, the web UI only supports the query and update for the appointments after current date. And the database dump file only generate the schedule data up to May 2018. In order to support the full functionalities of the application after that time, you should generate more test data for the appropriate dates. Reference to the schedule.py file under test-data-generator directory for the use to generate mysql syntaxes to insert data.
  Start your MySQL server:
  ```bash
  mysqld_safe -u 'mysql'
  ```
  Edit ./backend/utils/database-variables.js file with your MySQL server configuration.
  ```javascript
  // edit ./backend/utils/database-variables.js
  const MYSQL_CONFIG={
  host     : 'yourhosturl',
  user     : 'yourusername',
  password : 'yourpassword',
  database : 'CampusRide'
  }
  module.exports = {MYSQL_CONFIG}

  ```
  
* Auth0 service setup
  
  The authentification of the app use Auth0 based JWT authentification method. There is a free tier for use Auth0, check out the website (https://auth0.com/) for more details. After setting up an api/client of on Auth0 account, edit ./backend/utils/auth0-variables.js and ./frontend/src/Auth/auth0-variables.js with your Auth0 configuration. For the backend compatibility of user profile process, it is recommended using the connection for Google account.
  
  ```javascript
  // edit ./backend/utils/auth0-variables.js
  const domain = 'yourauth0-domain.auth0.com';

  module.exports = {domain};
  ```
  
  ```javascript
  // edit ./frontend/src/Auth/auth0-variables.js
  export const AUTH_CONFIG = {
  domain: 'yourauth0-domain.auth0.com',
  clientId: 'your-auth0-clientId',
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3001/callback', // you need set call back url at Auth0
  audience: 'your-audience'
  }
  ```
  
* Backend setup and run
  From the project root directory, 
  
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install  # install node pakages for backend
  node ./bin/www # run backend server on default port 3000
  
  ```
  
  The backend api will talk to MySQL server and listen on port 3000 for data fetching requests.

* Frontend setup and run
  From the project root directory,
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install # install node pakages
  PORT=3001 npm start # start frontend server on port 3001
  ```
  Open your browser, enter and open url https://yourserverurl:3001 (http://localhost:3001 if you run on your local machine) to see the main page of the application.
  
## Development Starting Point and Framework

* Frontend (React 4 + Bootstrap 4)

  For the simplicity setup about React, I use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) framework as the starting point of the project.
  
  For the bootstrap and html components, I use the theme/template [Light Bootstrap Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/light-bootstrap-dashboard) for the basic structure design.
  
* Backend (Node.js + Express)

  I use [express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) framework as the starting point of the backend api. Since the backend server serves like a data API, there is no need for some view template setup in the initial generating framework.
  
  
## Business Rules and Assumptions

The system support three kind of user to login, *student*, *driver* and *manager* (admin user). The student can make/change appointment for two kinds of rides, auto ride and golf cart ride. The auto ride has fixed timetable and stops which is free while the golf cart ride can have customized pick-up time and do not have spercific drop off location with more flexibility thus it is chargeable. The driver would be assigned to specific vehicle (including auto and cart) on specific date by manager.

### Full Use Case

Student can register and login to the system to make the appointment for golf cart or auto ride. After the ride, they can give the feedback and rate the driver or the ride. Manager (admin user) can login to make schedule for the auto line or golf cart to drivers on specific date. Driver can login to the system to check the schedule and finish the cart ride trip by filling the billing information.

### Implemented Parts

For the database, it implements the whole part of the full use case including 12 tables with generalizaiton/specialization relationship. In this web application, due to the time limitation, I only implemented some key functionalities of the student user part, which includes **looking up auto/cart schedule timetable, registration, log in, log out, make/look up/cancel appointments, look up/update profile**. 

### More About Auto Ride

The auto ride has scheduled lines and timetable. Each auto with associated timetable would be assigned to a driver on spercific working day by the manager. After manager's schedule, student can look up and see the scheduled auto ride timetable by choosing the pick up stop, drop off stop and date. Right now, for the test data (which is included in SQL dump file), I use the existing [UNCC Next Ride](http://nextride.uncc.edu/). The stop information is refrenced from https://pats.uncc.edu/transportation/transportation-tracking. The routes in the next ride, gold, silver and green line are corresponding to line 0, 1, 2 in SQL route table. 

### More About Cart Ride

Cart ride and have customizable pick up time and do not need set the spercific drop off location. Thus, it is more flexible and maybe chargeable. For the pick up communication concern, it should have spercific pick up location at the time making appointment. Each scheduled cart with assigned driver could only have one appointment within half hour.

## Web UI 

The frontend use React 4 + Bootstrap 4. The view part is based on the theme/template from Creative Tim's [Light Bootstrap Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/light-bootstrap-dashboard). 

### Public/Guest Time Table Look Up

**Without login** , the guest user can look up the scheduled auto time table by choosing date, pick up stop and drop off stop. The auto time table shows the scheduled auto ride with spercific pick up time and drop off time. It only shows the auto ride with seats lelf. Also, by choosing the date and pick up stop, the guest user can also look up the available cart with assigned driver. Each golf cart with assigned driver can only have one appointment within half hour.

</p>

### User Authentification

In order to have full functionalities, the user is required to login. The current emplimentation of user authentification system use JWT based [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). For better backend compatibility, I suggest use google connection besides the native registration and login support.

### Manage Appointments (create, look up and cancel)

**After login**, 
* the user can *make* new appointments:

   <img src='./imgs/ScreenShot-CartAppointment.png' width='400' alt='Make Cart Appointment'>
</p>

* *look up* and *cancel* appointment information:

</p>

### Manage Profile 

**After login**, the user can look up the user profile stored in the system. For the user login via google account, the system could automaticaly retrieve the user profile information, e.g. first name, last name and email from google account.

## EERD

The database design contains 13 tables. It has the following assumption/rules:

* Each route(or Line) has a fixed sequence of stops and the elapse time from the first stop

* Each auto has fixed timetable with a line and spercific staring time

* Each auto would be assigned to a driver by manager which represented by the Schedule table in the design

* Each cart would be assigned to a driver by manager which also included in the Schedule table in the design

* Cart ride appointment is chargeable and has custermizable pick up time without spercific drop off location

* Auto ride appointment has pick up stop and drop off stop along with the spercific route time schedule

</p>

### Generalization / Specialization

In the design, Vehicle is the **generalization** for the Cart and Auto. CartRide and AutoRide are **specialization** for the Appointment with common attribute, *apt_id, student_id, schedule_id, rating, comment, pick_up_time and pick_up_stop*.

## SQL Implementation Details

### Stored Procedure 

Since Auto Ride and Cart Ride are fully participated in the specialization relationship with Appointment and every auto appointment should have selected drop off stop at the time making it, it is convenient and good for abstraction to provide insert_auto_ride store procedure which hides the implementation details about the specialization relationship to application program. The *insert_auto_ride* procedure firstly insert the auto appointment records to the Appointment table, then insert the additional attributes into the AutoRide table using the *last_insert_id()* function.  

```mysql
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `insert_auto_ride`(stu_id int, sche_id int, pik_time time, pik_stop int, drop_stop int)
begin
	insert into Appointment(student_id, schedule_id, type, pick_up_time, pick_up_stop)
	values(stu_id, sche_id, 'auto', pik_time, pik_stop);
	set @apt_id = (select last_insert_id());
	insert into AutoRide(apt_id, drop_off_stop)
	values(@apt_id, drop_stop);
end
```

### Trigger

Auto and Cart are fully participated in the generalization relationship with Vehicle. There are foreign keys *vehicle_id* in both table referencing to Vehicle table. Therefor, it is natural to create two triggers before the *insert* apperation on Auto and Cart Tables. 

```mysql
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` TRIGGER `CampusRide`.`Auto_BEFORE_INSERT` 
before INSERT ON `Auto` 
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	insert into Vehicle
    values(new.vehicle_id, 'auto');
END

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` TRIGGER `CampusRide`.`Cart_BRFORE_INSERT` 
before INSERT ON `Cart` 
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	insert into Vehicle
    values(new.vehicle_id, 'cart');
END
```

### CRUD API

* Public API (without user authentification)
  * **Read** <a id='auto-query'>Auto Time Table</a>: 
    ```javascript
    // in ./backend/routes/public.js
    /* version one

        // As requirement, each auto ride with assigned driver can only have one appointment within 0.5 hour
        const datetime = moment(req.body.datetime);
        let date = datetime.format('YYYY-MM-DD');
        date = '\''+date+'\'';
        let time1 = datetime.subtract(0.5,'hours').format('hh:mm')
        time1 = '\'{}\''.format(time1);

        ```

* API Required Authentification
    * **Create** Appointment:
        ```javascript
        // in ./backend/routes/student.js
        if(req.body.pick_up_stop&&req.body.pick_up_time)
        req.body.student_id = req.user.student_id;
        // auto ride: call stored procedure 
        if(req.body.drop_off_stop){
          let sql = 'call insert_auto_ride('+
          '{student_id}, {schedule_id}, \'{pick_up_time}\', {pick_up_stop}, {drop_off_stop})'.format(req.body);

          return update_data(sql)(req, res, next);
        }
        ```
    * **Update** Profile:
        ```javascript 
        // in ./backend/routes/student.js
        let sql='update Student set first_name=\'{first_name}\', last_name=\'{last_name}\', disabled_injured={disabled_injured}, cellphone=\'{cellphone}\' '.format(req.body);
        sql+=' where student_id='+req.user.student_id;
        ```
    * **Delete** Appointment:
        ```javascript
        // in ./backend/routes/student.js
            process_data = async (req, res, next)=>{
          if(req.body.apt_ids){

            for(let apt_id of req.body.apt_ids){
              student_id = await findUserByAppointment(apt_id);
              if(student_id!=req.user.student_id){
                res.status(401).send(); // unauthorized error

              else sql += ' or apt_id='+apt_id;
              index+=1;
            }
            if(index==0) return next();
            return update_data(sql)(req, res, next);
          }
          next();
          }
        ```
        In order to make sure the cancelation appointments belong to the requested user, e.g. malicious user may send manually crafted http request to backend API with appointment not made by himself, it checks every appointment's owner before cancellation by call *findUserByAppointment* function.
    
    * For more **Read** API for authentification users, e.g. read appointments, check out *./backend/routes/student.js* file.
    
        

### View

Each auto is associated with certain lines and start time in TimeTable. The frequent query about the auto time table should should support with certain pick up stop and drop off stop. Thus, creating a *View* for *stoptimetable* can simplify the query SQL. Since there are seldom *update* or *delete* operations on the associated tables, *TimeTable* and *Route*, there is little overhead for maintaining the view. Thus, it is much reasonable to create the view here.

 ```mysql
 CREATE VIEW `stoptimetable`  AS 
 SELECT 
    `linetable`.`line_id` AS `line_id`,

### Indexes

In the MySql implementation, each foreign key should associated with a foreign key index. Since all the queries in *where* and *join* condition we used in [CRUD API](#crud-api) are key or foreign key attributes, there is no need for supplementary indexes created for the optimization. It is indeed better to create indexes for *pick_up_stop* and *drop_off_stop* columns on view table *stoptimetable*, but it seems that the views in MySQL is not materializated and can not create indexes on them.

## ToDo

* Optimize Auto Time Table Query:

    As can be seen in the <a href='#auto-query'>CRUD API</a> section, it much complex even with the *stoptimetable* view created. Moreover, it is the most frequent query in the application. Thus, some denormalization and redundant attribute (e.g. drop off time) should made for efficiency.
 
* Develop Manager Web UI and Backend API:
    Right now, in order maintain the usage of the application for test or other use, the schedule can only be made directly to the database. In the [./mysql-database/test-data-generator/schedule.py](https://github.com/qychen13/CampusRide-React-Express-MySQL/blob/master/mysql-database/test-data-generator/schedule.py), it contains the script to generate MySQL syntax for the new schedule.
